title: My Statistics Projects!
---

Recently, I have been working hard on improving my statistical knowledge and doing data analysis projects in R and creating reports of my projects using R-markdown. 

I am enrolled in the online specialization "Statistics with R", provided by Duke University and hosted by Coursera. The data analysis projects are assignments within this 5-course specialization. 

The 5 courses are:
 - Introduction to Statistics and Probability
 - Inferential Statistics
 - Linear Regression and Modeling
 - Bayesian Inference
 - Capstone Project

At this point I have completed the first two courses and I am uploading my final assignments as separate blogposts following this current one. 

Even though I am uploading two project files in quick succession, I want to point out that I have put a lot of work into these courses. I'm very thorough at studying the material, which means:
 * watching lecture videos multiple times
 * doing every single exercise and covering all the reading material
 * only moving forward if I really understand the content
 * retaking quizzes to get higher scores
 * carrying out cohesive data analysis projects
 * putting time and effort into reviewing other peoples work and giving helpful feedback including coding examples that would improve their project

Although it is not the quickest way of getting to my certificate, I believe this way of studying will be of the greatest value to me and my peers. 

That's it for now..

Ciao,
Georg
