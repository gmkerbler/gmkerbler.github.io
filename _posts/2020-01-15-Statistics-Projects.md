title: My Statistics Projects!
---

Recently, I have been working hard on improving my statistical knowledge and doing data analysis projects in R and creating reports of my projects using R-markdown. 

I am enrolled in the online specialization "Statistics with R", provided by Duke University and hosted by Coursera. The data analysis projects are assignments within this 5-course specialization. 

The 5 courses are:
 - Introduction to Statistics and Probability
 - Inferential Statistics
 - Linear Regression and Modeling
 - Bayesian Inference
 - Capstone Project

At this point I have completed the first two courses and I am uploading my final assignments as separate blogposts following this current one.

That's it for now..

Ciao,
Georg
