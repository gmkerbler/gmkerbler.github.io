title: Statistics with R - Probability and Data
---

This is my final project for the course "Introduction to Probability and Data". 
It covers data analysis of a survey data set including a discussion on the data set itself and then answering three research questions (I chose myself) through:

 * Exploratory Data Analysis
 * Summary Statistics and Plotting
 * Interpretation of Findings


*The Project file starts here...*
