I am passionate about solving important problems and making useful discoveries using data science and analytics.

I have a Masters in Biotechnology, a PhD in Neuroscience and I'm currently working towards joining the data science industry.

To get there, I am doing courses in statistics, programming, computer science and machine learning.

I am posting my progress here on my personal blog!

### More Information

I like doing sports including calasthenics, rock climbing, basketball, soccer and yoga. I live out my creative side through baking my own sourdough bread, playing guitar and cooking.
